      Hi Flightsters,
    </p>
    <p>
      While I don't know if the Glastonbury High School Gym will be open tomorrow,
      I would suggest using discretion on your decision to travel tomorrow. If
      things look bad, stay home! There is also the chance that you may travel and
      find the gym closed. Unfortunately, I have no control over this and no way to
      know if or not the town will open the facility. So make a wise choice!
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I plan on staying home and building a model!
    </p>
    <p>
      Please forward this to anyone else that might use this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      See you soon.
    </p>
    <p>
