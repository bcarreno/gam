Greetings Aeromodelers!
=======================

Are you ready for some indoor flying? We'll be starting up at Glastonbury High School for another
great, fun season of indoor modeling. The first session of the season  will be on **November 8th**.
We have the normal two contests scheduled for this season in January and April with lots of
flying opportunities.
Please note that the schedule does NOT contain any flying sessions for February and March.
I take the blame for this as I did not contact the town early enough. Sorry for the schedule
alteration.

The flying fee for the season will be again be $75.00. The Glastonbury Modelers relies
on all of you to keep our indoor flying "in-the-green". If you don't fly with us,
donations are certainly accepted. You can pay at the first session or, if you wish to
mail your payment, send it to:

If the weather ever looks iffy for a session, please contact me either by email
or phone the night before the session. Contact information  can be found on
the [home page](/).
Remember that we are at the mercy of the
town of Glastonbury and dates may be subject to change. Better to check
than to drive an hour to find out the session was canceled! Don't
risk the drive if driving conditions are poor.

I'm looking for volunteers to run **"mini-meets"** at the half-day sessions.
These can be either/or FAC or AMA events, or maybe something fun and new!
I would prefer to stick to only one event per half-day session to help
keep it no-pressure fun. Mass launch, duration, racing.... What ever you
want to try! Kanones will be awarded for FAC mini-meet events. Contact
me via email or phone to take a date and run a mini-meet for a session.
We'll want to give our flightsters a month advance notice of these special events.

This year's Armstead Trophy model is Dan Marcus' **Lil' Zip**. All official
flight will be ROG. Fly as many attempts as you like throughout the season!

1. Build to the plan but you may move the motor peg location.
2. Japanese Tissue covering only and covering on both sides.
3. Prop of your choice but remember prop clearance for ROG!
4. Wheels may be your choice but they must maintain the diameter shown on the plans as a minimum.

Plan on an ROG mass launch event at one of the contests. Judges decision is final.

The subject of indoor R/C should be mentioned. The Glastonbury Modelers
has a history as an indoor free flight club and intends to remain an
indoor free flight club. **No indoor R/C**. Pretty simple. Until further
notice, **only** free flight models will be allowed to fly at Glastonbury
High School during our sessions. We intend to continue to encourage
and promote indoor free flight as the unique and chal-lenging aspect
of aeromodeling it represents.

Looking forward to seeing you all this coming indoor season.

John Koptonak
